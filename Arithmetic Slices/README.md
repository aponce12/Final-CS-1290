Arithmetic slices

A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, these are arithmetic sequence:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
The following sequence is not arithmetic.

1, 1, 2, 5, 7

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.

A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.

The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.


Example:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.


Solution
1. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming because the difference of each set of numbers can be stored in another data structure, such as an array, the number of times that the difference between three numbers is true one will be added to the array. At the end we will return the sum of all the elements of the array. dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - 1];

2. We can use an array to store the number of times that an arithmetic slice is valid, but this will give us a space complexity of O(n). We can keep track of sum storing it in one variable dp and return the last number stored in this variable as sum, space complexity O(1).

3. Code
Note: Updated code with space complexity of O(1)

class Solution {
    public int numberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] A) {
        int dp = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < A.length; i++) {
            if (A[i] - A[i - 1] == A[i - 1] - A[i - 2]) {
                dp = 1 + dp;
                sum += dp;
            } else
                dp = 0;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
